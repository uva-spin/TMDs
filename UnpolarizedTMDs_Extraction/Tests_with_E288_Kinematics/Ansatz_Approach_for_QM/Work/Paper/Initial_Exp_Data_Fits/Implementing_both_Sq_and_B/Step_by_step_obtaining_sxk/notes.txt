Here we call the trained models for Sq(qT,x1,x2) and trying to obtain two separate s(x,k) 
one for target and one for beam: s(x1,k) and s(x2,k')

Test_1:
Based on the trained models to the cross-section data, we generate the SqT values for a grid with
Fixed x2 and vary x1 and qT from the values in data files.
Then, Trained the sub-models n1 and n2 for target/beam
Then, generated csv files for SqT to compare with the trained data and a grid for n1
Then, generated plots


Test_2
Hidden_Layers = 3
Nodes_per_HL = 100
NUM_REPLICAS = 50

Test_3
What we want to do Here:
1. Fix qT to let's say 0.5.
2. Sample over x1 and x2 where x1,x2 = {0.1-0.3}
3. Plot n1(x1,k) and n2(x2,k')

Test_4
Same as Test_3
