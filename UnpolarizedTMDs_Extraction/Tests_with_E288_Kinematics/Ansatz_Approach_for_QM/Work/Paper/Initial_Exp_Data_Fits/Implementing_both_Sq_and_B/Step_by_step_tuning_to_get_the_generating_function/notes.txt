Test_00
Original unconstrained fit results


Test_1

Data
E288_200: 4.5, 5.5, 6.5

initial_lr = 0.001
epochs = 1000 
batch_size = 8

DNNB details
Hidden layer 1, 50 nodes, all 'relu'

DNNS
Hidden layer 1: 100 nodes
Hidden layer 2: 100 nodes
Hidden layer 3: 100 nodes

This seems similar to the one with DNNB has 250 nodes
and the DNNS, other hp the same as this one



Test_2

Data
E288_200: 4.5, 5.5, 6.5
E288_400: 5.5

initial_lr = 0.001
epochs = 1000 
batch_size = 8

DNNB details
Hidden layer 1, 50 nodes, all 'relu'

DNNS
Hidden layer 1: 100 nodes
Hidden layer 2: 100 nodes
Hidden layer 3: 100 nodes
Hidden layer 4: 100 nodes

Not a good one


Test_3
I wanted to check what if we wanted to do a fit only 
to all E288_200 Data. Used same hyperparameters as in Test_1.


Test_4
I want to include the s in the denominator to check.
It seems working fine the only thing is the scale of B is so large.
I suspect that has something to do with the 16pi^2 factor.


Test_5
Let's include the E288_400 data set along with E288_200 with
Test_4 setup


Test_6
Let's include all E288 data sets
Cross-sections seem good 
but BQM, SqT are not


Test_7
After confirming that our formulation is the same as Ted's resuming tuning from Test_2
Same as Test_2

Test_8
We we want to do is to modify the formalism to have 1/s with Test_4


Test_9
Test_8 with full E288_200 and E288_400 datasets
Noticed that SqT becomes negative

Test_10
A trial with optimizing hp

Test_11
Re-running the original fit
On this one modified_LR was not implemented


Test_12
Original with no cuts
modified_LR is included


Test_13
Original with only upsilon cut
modified_LR is included
This seems better


Test_14
Test_13 with increased complexity on SqT


Test_15
Progressive DNN
Implementing prog_test.py with Test_11 original fit


Test_16
Progressive DNN
Implementing prog_basic.py with Test 15 (original fit)

Test_17
Same as Test_13 but un-integrated in QM

Test_18
Test_13 with E288_200

Test_19
Test_13 with E288_400

Test_20
Test_13 with (1/s) modification


Test_21
Only fit to data upto  QM=8.5 GeV


Test_22
Only E288_200 and E288_300 data with Test 13


Test_23
Multiply (1+ qT2/Q2) for Test_20

Test_24
Having more statistics from
E288_200: QM = 4.5, 5.5, 6.5
E288_400: QM = 5.5, 6.5, 7.5
added five sets from each
Modified the code from Test_19


Test_25
Same as Test_24 but with linear actv in SqT


Test_26
Test_24 with both cuts qT < 0.2 QM and upsilon cut 

Test_27
Modified Test_24 without those additional statistics but having SqrtS weight in the loss
weights = w / mean_w

Test_28
Modified Test_27 having SqrtS*SqrtS weight in the loss
weights = w / mean_w

Test_29
Modified Test_28 with weight QM
weights = w / mean_w

Test_30
Modified Test_28 with weight qT
weights = w / mean_w

Test_31
Modified Test_28 with weight SqrtS
weights = w

Test_32
Modified Test_31 with weight SqrtS^2
weights = w

Test_33
Modified Test_31 with weight QM
weights = w

Test_34
Modified Test_31 with weight qT
weights = w


Test_35
Modifying the code to implemtent prog_basic

Test_36
Test_35 Progressive DNN with both cuts


Test_37
Test_36 Progressive DNN with both cuts with increased complexity on B


Test_38
Implementing weight on each row based on the kinematics
This is to impose a higher weight for those six QM bins (3 from 200 and 3 from 400)
weight = 100

Test_39
Implement Test_38 with progressive DNN from Test_35

Test_40
Same as Test_39 but Test_39 was not doing what we wanted so attempted correcting not completed
so then tried the following with Test_35
def pdf(pdfset, flavor, x, QQ):
    return pdfset.xfxQ2(flavor, x, QQ)
pay close attention if using this Test_41 for any other tests

Test_41
Same as Test_38 but more weight
weight = 500

Test_42
Attempting to correct the code from Test_39
Got a working version but need to check. Going to do in Test_43
Not working

Test_43
Progressive DNN
This is working correctly.
weight = 500

So with the weights we have
Test 38, and Test 43


Test_44
Added a SqrtS in front of the cross-section as a test don't use this


Test_45
Test 38 with weight = 1000

Test_46
Test_43 with weight = 1000
