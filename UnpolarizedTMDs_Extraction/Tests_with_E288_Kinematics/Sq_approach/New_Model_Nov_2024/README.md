# This is the log of the evolution of this folder

#Test0
This folder contains some initial files.

#Test1
Pseudodata was generated for the function A(pT) = integration_0_2 dk [S1(k)S2(pT-k) + S1(pT-k)S2(k)]
The two DNNs represents the two flavors S1 and S2 k dependence

#Test2
Testing with different options in the architecture

#Test3 
Considering the phi integration
Updated the pseudo-data generation script as well as fitting script

#Test4
Considering two inputs k and QM for S1 and S2
k integration limits 0 to 2

#Test5
Same as Test4 but k integration from 0.0001 to 10

#Test6
Same as Test5 but splitting the training part which saves two separate models and an additional script to make plots based on the saved models
